        The body text for site-01. I think this has to hit over 140 characters
        (or maybe it's 280) before it is classified as "readerable" by
        Readability.

        Let's see if this is enough. Here's the short story "New Years Eve" by
        Lydia Davis.

        I ask my friend Bob what his New Year’s Resolutions are and he says,
        with a shrug (indicating that this is obvious or not surprising ): to
        drink less, to lose weight… He asks me the same, but I am not ready to
        answer him yet. I have been studying my Zen again, in a mild way, out of
        desperation over the holidays, though mild desperation. A medal or a
        rotten tomato, it’s all the same, says the book I have been reading.
        After a few days of consideration, I think the most truthful answer to
        my friend Bob would be: My New Year’s Resolution is to learn to see
        myself as nothing. Is this com¬petitive? He wants to lose some weight, I
        want to learn to see myself as nothing. Of course, to be competitive is
        not in keeping with any Buddhist philosophy. A true nothing is not
        competitive. But I don’t think I’m being competitive when I say it. I am
        feeling truly humble, at that moment. Or I think I am—in fact, can
        anyone be truly humble at the moment they say they want to learn to be
        nothing? But there is another problem, which I have been wanting to
        describe to Bob for a few weeks now: at last, halfway through your life,
        you are smart enough to see that it all amounts to nothing, even success
        amounts to nothing. But how does a person learn to see herself as
        nothing when she has already had so much trouble learning to see herself
        as, something in the first place? It’s so confusing. You spend the first
        half of your life learning that you are something after all, now you
        have to spend the second half learning to see yourself as nothing. You
        have been a negative nothing, now you want to be a positive nothing. I
        have begun trying, in these first days of the New Year, bur so far it’s
        pretty difficult. I’m pretty close to nothing all morning, but by late
        afternoon what is in me that is something starts throwing its weight
        around. This happens many days. By evening, I’m full of something and
        it’s often something nasty and pushy. So what I think at this point is
        that I’m aiming too high, that maybe nothing is too much, to begin with.
        Maybe for now I should just try, each day, to be a little less than I
        usually am.
